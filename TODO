IMMEDIATE ITEMS:
- recording should be able to be turned off
- better cookie handling in HttpClient.  excluding domain and path as hard coded exclusion values is REALLY janky
- fail if tests pass too quickly

NEXT STEPS
- write a CometClient

Notes from talk with Jan:
=========================
Capacity planning:
- Testing conncurrently gives you a better idea of how to plan for capacity
  (i.e. if we get 40rps vs a production like environment and we need 80rps, then we need to add another box)

CI for performance:
- One suite that runs against demo
- One suite that runs against staging
- Triggered by deployments

Other thoughts:
- Profiling vs. Benchmarking: profile to find out what actions are slow. Benchmark to for capacity planning.
