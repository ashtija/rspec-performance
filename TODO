- implement sanity checking for requests that are redirected
    - We can no longer just validate HTTP response codes, we need to dig into page internals to verify that the page that was requested is the correct page.  The time required to do this should not count towards the iteration time.
- implement better debugging
    - matchers need to output detailed http request and response information in the event of a failure
- tests should fail when they run too quickly
- implement redirect following in the http client


IMMEDIATE ITEMS:
- recording should be able to be turned off
- better cookie handling in HttpClient.  excluding domain and path as hard coded exclusion values is REALLY janky
- fail if tests pass too quickly

NEXT STEPS
- write a CometClient

Notes from talk with Jan:
=========================
Capacity planning:
- Testing conncurrently gives you a better idea of how to plan for capacity
  (i.e. if we get 40rps vs a production like environment and we need 80rps, then we need to add another box)

CI for performance:
- One suite that runs against demo
- One suite that runs against staging
- Triggered by deployments

Other thoughts:
- Profiling vs. Benchmarking: profile to find out what actions are slow. Benchmark to for capacity planning.
